     <p>A very amazing and thrilling classic! This may be the most greatest Godzilla remake ever made and is more realistic than the 1998 remake. I even first saw this when I was in 7th grade during middle school. When I saw this for the first time I was pretty amazed and thrilled to see a new Godzilla film in theaters for the first time. I even remember right before the movie even came out there was a Snickers commercial that featured Godzilla hanging out with all the cool people and showing how cool he really is when he's king of the monsters! Like I said in my review of Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla, I've always been a big fan of the franchise ever since I was in primary school. This film had very good special effects and a brand new monster. The special effects were very jaw dropping than the old ones. Ever since I watched these movies, I have always gotten use to the cheesy special effects, miniature sets, and the "guys in rubber suits" technique. But now, I'm really getting use to the CGI technique. I was even surprised to see a new opponent for Godzilla because to be honest, it has been since 1955 since he first fought Angurius in Godzilla Raids Again. I still am very impressed that Warner Bros. and Legendary have agreed to make an American remake of the most famous Japanese monster classic from 1954. Gonna give this 5 stars.</p>

   <p>I loved the movie a lot 
    As I am a great fan of marvel
    Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>
